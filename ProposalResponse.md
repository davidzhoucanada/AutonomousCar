# Group 15 - Car

## Tentative Rating
Above Average for most of those features you described. Average for simply an advanced RC car (i.e. no neural net, no autonomous behaviour).

## Comments
 - What track and where? What traffic lights?
 - Probably a backup would be just to turn it into some advanced RC car, in case things don't go the way you expect.
 - You will have to figure out how the car works
 - You will have to re-wire the car to work with the Arduino. There are some cheating ways around this though without re-wiring I suppose.
 - What happens if you can't interface with the RC car?
 - Not clear what the purpose of the neural net even is.
